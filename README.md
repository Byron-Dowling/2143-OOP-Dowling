Project Title: Homework 1 - Basic Project Organization
Author: Byron Dowling
Description: 
This assignment is to emphasize the importance of organizing a programming project above and beyond the "code" itself. If someone cannot decipher your code, they rely on comments. If someone cannot run your code, they rely on instructions. If someone wants to use something you wrote in their own project (non academically!) they will rely on good comments, a good description of the project, and good instructions on how to use your project. From my standpoint, I need these things to grade projects with minimal issues. All of this will make more sense as the semester goes on, and you see how we utilize command line parameters and external libraries in our projects.

You will NOT be allowed to attend class after the due date until this is done. This means if your repo does not exist, and this assignment is not in your repo, then I will ask you to leave class. Why you say? Because if you cannot comment a program, create a readme, and upload it to Github then the chances of you succeeding in this class are next to none.
Every single folder on your repo should contain a README.md. This is because when I or someone else looks at your repo, and clicks on a folder, they will see not just a directory listing, but an explanation and description of what that folder contains. I'm not making you create README's to be an ass ... I promise. It simply adds credibility to your repo, and makes you look like you know what your doing (and care and visitors to your site). I understand that a lot (if not most) probably don't want anyone looking at your repo, but you should still put your best foot forward. When I browse repos on Github, I not only rely on the README files for information, but find myself judging the software or library based on how organized and descriptive the README's are. And after talking to other developers, I found that I'm not the only one.
