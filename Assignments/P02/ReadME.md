## Program #2 -P02- BlackJack Game
### Byron Dowling
### Description:

Eventually the program will take shape into actual files but for now this is a conceptual assignemnt with determining our stategy for what aspects of the BlackJack game should be in classes and what can be inherited from. This include an in-depth description of each proposed class as well as what data members and methods woudl be implemented. See below.

## Proposed Class Layout

#### Class: Card
> This class is most likely going to be the main parent class that other classes will either inherit from or directly utilize through member objects. As the title says, this is where we will design and handle all aspects of how the cards will function as they will be essential for the remaining aspects of the game.

> ##### Member Variables:
> - int suit
> - int rank
> - int value
> - string FaceCardRank
> - string SuitType
